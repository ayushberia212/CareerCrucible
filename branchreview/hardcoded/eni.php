                <p>Instrumentation engineering is about managing processes by monitoring and measuring various parameters. Instrumentation engineering design, builds, install and maintain monitoring and measurement devices. Instrumentation ensures that problems are detected early and that processes run efficiently and smoothly. </p>
        <p> As a concept, Instrumentation per se is as old as human thought- human have always wanted to measure parameters in the world around. But department of Instrumentation engineering are of more recent vintage, emerging in the 1970s and 1980s. It originated as offshoots of electrical engineering. Then gradually, these programs became multi-disciplinary, seeking inputs from mechanical, electronics, computer science, chemical, etc. branches of engineering. Till the 1960s and 1970s Instrumentation was only about measurement so that humans could judge what part of the process to adjust from studying the values of parameters involved. Later, as electrical, electronics and computer science disciplines progressed; controlling processes also became an integral part of in Instrumentation.

                 <p>The curriculum incudes deeper mathematics training and exposure to several science courses. It is essential to understand programming languages. Data structures, basic analogue and digital circuits, electronics devices, signal processing, microprocessors, control systems, communication systems, hydraulics and pneumatics, sensors, embedded systems, etc. specific to instrumentation and controls are courses in advanced process control, robotics, and automation, medical instrumentation, virtual instrumentation, neural networks, sensors, networking, etc.</p> </div>

            <h4>JOB OPPORTUNITIES </h4>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-12">
               
                <p>Typically, graduates of tis discipline are exposed to programming and software design (for the purpose of processing instrumentation data and controlling the system) and are trained to think logically, which enables them to consider a career in software services. Normally, students also do several projects involving hardware. This training helps them to get job in several companies like device manufacturers. Alternatively, they can apply for jobs in companies which recruit electronics and communication engineers. Students are also trained in problem solving and troubleshooting. This enables them to easily switch careers and opt for non- core jobs.</p>
        <p> Almost every industry needs people with an instrumentation background. Industries where accidents could prove costly make it a point to recruit Instrumentation engineers. Hence job opportunities exist in chemical industries, petro-chemical (refineries), steel industry, etc. research labs like DRDO, and organizations like BARC, ISRO, etc. also need Instrumentation engineers.</p>
        <p> There are no large recruiters unlike IT sector and computer science and engineering and electrical engineering disciplines.</p> 
        <p> Higher education is a possibility. However, very few departments dedicated specifically to Instrumentation engineering exist in the top universities in India and overseas. Best is to identify electrical engineering departments with active research in instrumentation, and apply to those places. Start this research in your 4th year itself. Being an applied discipline, a lot of research takes place in the industry.
